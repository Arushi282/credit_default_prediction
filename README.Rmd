# Credit Default Payment Predictor
- Authors: Arushi Ahuja, Karanpreet Kaur, Lianna Hovhannisyan, Taiwo Owoseni

Using Logistic Regression to predict whether the customer will do credit default payment next month or not.

## About
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

In this project, we built a classification model using Logistic Regression to predict if credit account holders will make a default payment next month. The model was trained on features that hold information about the client's last 6 months bill and payment history, as well as several other characteristics such as: age, marital status, education, and gender. Overall, we are more interested in minimizing Type | error (predicting no default payment, when in reality the client made a default payment the following month), as opposed to Type || error (predicting default payment, when in reality no default payment was made by the client), we are using $f1$ as our primary scoring metric. Our model performed fairly well....

The data set used in the project is created by Yeh, I. C., and Lien, C. H [@Yeh2009TheCO], and made publicly available for download in UCI Machine Learning Repository [@misc_default_of_credit_card_clients_350]. The data can be found [here](<https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients>), specifically [this file](<https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00350/default%20of%20credit%20card%20clients.xls>). The dataset is based on Taiwan's credit card client default cases from April to September. It has 30000 examples, and each example represents particular client's information. The dataset has 24 observations with respective values such as gender, age, marital status, last 6 months bills, last 6 months payments, etc, including the final default payment of next month column: labeled 1 (client will make a default) and 0 (client will not make a default).

## Report
The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/credit_default_prediction/blob/main/doc/).

## Usage

- To replicate the analysis, clone this GitHub repository. 

- To set up the necessary packages for running the project, download the environment file from [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/credit_default_prediction/blob/main/environment.yaml): hit “Raw” and then Ctrl/Cmnd + S to save it, or copy paste the content. 
Then create a Python virtual environment by using conda with the environment file you just downloaded:

```
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```

- Run the following command from the environment where you have JupyterLab installed (e.g. base).

```
conda install nb_conda_kernels
```

If you wish to not use conda environment, please make sure you have all the dependencies and packages installed in your local machine, found [here](#dependencies) under Dependencies, before running these commands. 

After setting up the environment or downloading the dependencies, follow up the instructions below. 

- Run the following commands at the command line/terminal from the root directory of this project:
